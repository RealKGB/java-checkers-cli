# java-checkers-cli
CLI checkers, written in Java.

Uses 2d arrays to display, takes advantage of ANSI colors and background colors for easy readability (doesn't work with all terminals). Does NOT support Command Prompt without configuration in ANSI.SYS to support colors - otherwise, works fine. Just `java Main` and enjoy.

There is no AI, it's two-player hot-seat. Maybe I'll add an AI someday. v1 will be solely two-player hot-seat.

GUI version will be available at [java-checkers-gui](https://github.com/RealKGB/java-checkers-gui)

Currently broken. I will fix it when I have time.
