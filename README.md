# java-checkers-cli
CLI checkers, written in Java.

Uses 2d arrays to display, takes advantage of ANSI colors and background colors for easy readability. Works on anything with a terminal or command prompt. Just `java Main` and enjoy.

There is no AI, it's two-player hot-seat. Maybe I'll add an AI someday. v1 will be solely two-player hot-seat.

TODO:

2. Optimize jump detection algorithm, if possible
