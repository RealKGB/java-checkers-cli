# java-checkers-cli
CLI checkers, written in Java.

Uses 2d arrays to display, takes advantage of ANSI colors and background colors for easy readability.

Works on anything with a terminal or command prompt. Just `java Main` and enjoy.

There is no AI, it's two-player hot-seat. Maybe I'll add an AI someday. v1 will be solely two-player hot-seat.

GUI version will be available at [java-checkers-gui](https://github.com/RealKGB/java-checkers-gui)
